# Project Conventions

> **Instance file**: This file contains project-specific conventions that supplement the generic rules in `core/conventions.md`.

## Purpose

The generic naming, coding, and Git conventions are defined in `core/conventions.md`. This file captures **project-specific additions** that apply only to this project, such as:

- Encoding requirements for specific file types
- Project-specific naming patterns
- Domain-specific coding rules
- Team workflow agreements

## Relationship to Core Conventions

- All rules in `core/conventions.md` still apply
- If a project convention conflicts with a core convention, document the reason here and get team agreement
- Project conventions should be considered for promotion to `core/conventions.md` if they prove universally useful
